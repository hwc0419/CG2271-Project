# CG2271-Project
CG2271 is the module code for "Real Time Operating Systems" (RTOS for short). The project for this module aims to design a miniature robotic car controlled wirelessly using a PS5 controller + Bluetooth. The controller acts as the interface, allowing users to move the car, change LED lighting patterns and play music simultaneously.
